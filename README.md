## Overview:
AquaGuard is an IoT-based water management system that simulates sensor data, analyzes trends, and provides recommendations for improving water efficiency and preventing leaks. The system monitors water flow, pressure, temperature, and detects leaks using simulated IoT sensor data. 
This application is designed to help optimize water usage, reduce water loss, and provide predictive insights for system maintenance.
